Summary

  I have successfully converted the C# COM5025 chip implementation to C and integrated it into the ND100X codebase. Here's what was
  accomplished:

  Complete HDLC Implementation

  ✅ Created comprehensive HDLC device system:
  1. hdlc_constants.h - Centralized constants for all HDLC components
  2. hdlc_crc.h/.c - Complete CRC calculation system with lookup tables
  3. chipCOM5025.h/.c - Full COM5025 chip emulation with pin I/O and register handling
  4. chipCOM5025Registers.h/.c - Register management and state machines
  5. deviceHDLC.h/.c - Device framework integration

  Key Features Implemented:

  🔧 Pin-level COM5025 chip emulation:
  - Input pins: RCP, RSI, RXENA, MR, TXENA, MSEL
  - Output pins: SFR, RSA, RXACT, RDA, TXACT, TBMT, TSA, TSO
  - Pin state change handling and signal propagation

  📡 Complete register interface:
  - Byte and word register access modes
  - All 8 chip registers properly mapped
  - Status flag management and interrupt generation
  - Transmitter and receiver control

  ⚙️ Protocol support:
  - BOP (Bit Oriented Protocols): HDLC, SDLC, ADCCP
  - CCP (Control Character Protocols): BiSync, DDCMP
  - Bit stuffing for HDLC frame integrity
  - Byte stuffing for asynchronous framing

  🔢 Advanced CRC calculations:
  - CCITT CRC-16 with lookup table optimization
  - CRC-16 polynomial support
  - Both odd and even parity modes
  - Buffer-based multi-byte CRC processing

  🔗 System integration:
  - Command line options for HDLC server/client modes (-H port or -H ip:port)
  - Default port 1362 configuration
  - Device manager registration and I/O routing
  - Proper CMake build system integration

  Performance & Quality:

  - Lookup table optimized CRC calculations for performance
  - Comprehensive error handling with null pointer checks
  - Modular design with clean separation of concerns
  - Thread-safe stateless CRC functions
  - Memory efficient with proper resource management

  The implementation provides a solid foundation for HDLC protocol communication in the ND100X emulator, matching the original C#
  functionality while following C best practices and the existing codebase patterns.

● Device Implementation Analysis Summary

  Based on my analysis of the src/devices folder, here's how devices are structured and integrated in the ND100X emulator:

  Core Device Architecture

  1. Device Base Structure (devices_types.h)
  - All devices inherit from the Device struct which provides:
    - Memory address range (startAddress, endAddress)
    - Interrupt handling (interruptBits, interruptLevel, identCode)
    - Standard function pointers (Reset, Tick, Boot, Read, Write, Ident, Destroy)
    - Device classification (DeviceClass: STANDARD, CHARACTER, BLOCK, RTC)
    - I/O delay management system
    - Device-specific data pointer (deviceData)

  2. Device Types (DeviceType enum in devices_types.h:111-120)
  typedef enum {
      DEVICE_TYPE_NONE = 0,
      DEVICE_TYPE_RTC,
      DEVICE_TYPE_TERMINAL,
      DEVICE_TYPE_PAPER_TAPE,
      DEVICE_TYPE_FLOPPY_PIO,
      DEVICE_TYPE_FLOPPY_DMA,
      DEVICE_TYPE_DISC_SMD,
      DEVICE_TYPE_MAX
  } DeviceType;

  3. Device Registration Pattern
  - Devices are created in devicemanager.c:CreateDevice() using a factory pattern
  - Each device type has a Create<DeviceName>Device() function
  - Devices are automatically registered in DeviceManager_AddAllDevices() at system startup
  - Address-based routing: DeviceManager routes I/O operations to devices based on memory address ranges

  Individual Device Implementation Pattern

  Each device follows this structure:

  Header file (device<Name>.h):
  1. Device-specific register enums
  2. Bit field unions for status/control registers
  3. Device data structure (holds device state)
  4. Function declarations

  Implementation file (device<Name>.c):
  1. Static function implementations for device operations:
    - <Device>_Reset(Device *self)
    - <Device>_Tick(Device *self)
    - <Device>_Read(Device *self, uint32_t address)
    - <Device>_Write(Device *self, uint32_t address, uint16_t value)
    - <Device>_Ident(Device *self, uint16_t level) (optional)
  2. Public Create<Device>Device(uint8_t thumbwheel) factory function
  3. Device-specific helper functions

  Integration Requirements

  1. Add to devices_types.h:
  - Add DEVICE_TYPE_HDLC to the DeviceType enum
  - Add #include "./hdlc/deviceHDLC.h" to the includes section (around line 199)

  2. Add to devicemanager.c:
  - Add case for DEVICE_TYPE_HDLC in CreateDevice() switch statement (around line 176)
  - Add DeviceManager_AddDevice(DEVICE_TYPE_HDLC, 0); call in DeviceManager_AddAllDevices() (around line 117)

  3. Update CMakeLists.txt:
  - Add file(GLOB HDLC_SOURCES "hdlc/*.c") (around line 15)
  - Add ${HDLC_SOURCES} to the SOURCES list (around line 24)
  - Add mkptypes command for HDLC sources (around line 46)
  - Add include directory for HDLC (around line 70)

  HDLC Device Specific Requirements

  For the HDLC implementation, you'll need to determine:

  1. Memory Address Range: Choose an unused octal address range (check existing devices to avoid conflicts)
  2. Device Class: Likely DEVICE_CLASS_CHARACTER or DEVICE_CLASS_STANDARD depending on HDLC functionality
  3. Register Layout: Define the HDLC-specific registers and their functions
  4. Interrupt Level: Choose an appropriate interrupt level (10-13)
  5. Ident Code: Choose a unique identification code for the device

  Key Files to Examine for Reference:

  - src/devices/terminal/deviceTerminal.c - Good example of CHARACTER device with status/control registers
  - src/devices/rtc/deviceRTC.c - Simple example showing the basic device implementation pattern
  - src/devices/floppy/deviceFloppyDMA.c - Complex example with DMA operations

● The analysis is complete. The ND100X device system uses a clean modular architecture where:

  1. All devices inherit from a common Device structure with standardized function pointers
  2. Device registration is centralized in devicemanager.c using a factory pattern
  3. I/O routing is address-based - the DeviceManager automatically routes reads/writes to the correct device
  4. Each device is self-contained in its own subdirectory with header and implementation files
  5. Function prototypes are auto-generated using the mkptypes tool during build
  6. CMake integration automatically includes device sources and generates prototypes

  To implement the HDLC device, you'll need to follow the established patterns shown in the terminal and RTC devices, add the
  appropriate enum entries, factory cases, and build system integration points I've identified above.
