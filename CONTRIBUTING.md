## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/HackerCorpLabs/nd100x/issues) to:

- Report a bug
- Request a new feature or device

- Track known issues or regressions

Please include:
- A clear title and description
- Reproduction steps (for bugs)
- Platform details (OS, compiler version, etc.)

---

## Code Style and Guidelines

- Use `int8_t`, `uint16_t`, etc. for fixed-width types
- Follow C89/C99 style formatting for consistency
- Keep functions short and focused
- Use `//` for inline comments, and `/* ... */` for block comments
- Avoid platform-specific code unless inside `#ifdef` guards
- Don‚Äôt include generated files or build output in commits

If unsure, match the style in surrounding code.

## Build and Test

This project uses `make` with multiple build modes:

- **Debug build**:
  ```bash
  make debug
  ```

- **Release build**:
  ```bash
  make release
  ```

- **Sanitized build** (for memory issue detection):
  ```bash
  make sanitize
  ```

> üìù You must have GCC, `make`, and a POSIX-like environment (Linux recommended).

If your change introduces new functionality or fixes a bug, consider adding or updating test programs.
